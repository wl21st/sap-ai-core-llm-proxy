## Why

The `TokenManager` class in `auth/token_manager.py` contains a TODO comment ("Create instance with the SubAccountConfig...") that has already been implemented. Keeping stale comments creates confusion about the state of the code.

## What Changes

- Remove the stale TODO comment from the `TokenManager` docstring.

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- No functional changes to capabilities, just code cleanup -->

## Impact

- `auth/token_manager.py`: Removal of 1 line of comment.
